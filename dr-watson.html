    <h5>Dr John Watson</h5></div>

    <div class="sherlockcontent">
    <p>Dr John H. Watson is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.</p><br>

    <p>In the debut Holmes story <i>'A Study in Scarlet'</i>, Watson, as the narrator, describes meeting Holmes, their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street, his attempts to discover the profession of his taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual taking of Watson into his confidence, and the events surrounding their first case together. Watson describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner for Holmes' taste. In time, they become close friends.</p><Br>

     <p>In <i>'The Sign of Four'</i>, John Watson met Mary Morstan, who became his wife. Mary seemed somewhat less sure of her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him 'James' in the short story <i>'The Man With the Twisted Lip'</i>.</p><Br>

    <p>This may be a simple typographical error, though some have speculated that it is a wifely reference to Watson's unknown middle name, which could have been 'Hamish' (Scottish for 'James'). Dorothy Sayers, creator of the detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later publishing this theory in 'Unpopular Opinions'.</p>
