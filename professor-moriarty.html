    <h5>Professor Moriarty</h5></div>

    <div class="sherlockcontent">
    <p>Professor James Moriarty, the arch-enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is a mathematics professor turned the world's only <i>'consulting criminal'</i>. His genius is equal to, if not perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.</p><br>

    <p>Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the <i>'Napoleon of crime'</i>. Conan Doyle borrowed this phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind, who is one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.</p><br>

    <p>The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories.</p><BR>

    <p>Moriarty is a genius, a philosopher and an abstract thinker, with a brain of the first order. As Holmes puts it: "He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them."</p><br>

    <p>Despite only appearing in two stories, Moriarty has been proven to be the most dangerous of all criminals that Holmes encounters. In the short story <i>'The Adventure of the Final Problem'</i>, during a fight with Holmes above the Reichenbach Falls, Moriarty falls to his death.</p>
