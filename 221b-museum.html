    <h5>The Sherlock Holmes Museum</h5></div>
 
    <div class="moviecontent">
        <p>The Sherlock Holmes Museum is situated within an <b>1815</b> townhouse very similar to the 221B described in the stories and is located between 237 and 241 Baker Street. Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership of the address by the Sherlock Holmes Museum has not been challenged.</p><br>

        <p>The museum displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum. The description of the house can be found throughout the stories, including the 17 steps leading from the ground-floor hallway to the first-floor study.</p><br>

        <p>There is now a museum on Baker Street, The Sherlock Holmes Museum. Open daily from 9.30 am - 6pm, admission is £15 for adults and £10 for children under 16.
