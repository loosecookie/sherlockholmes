    <h5>Irene Adler</h5></div>

    <div class="sherlockcontent">
    <p>Irene Adler, professionally known as <i>'The Woman'</i>, is a smart dominatrix who has an apparently romantic attraction to Sherlock Holmes.</p><br>

    <p>Whilst Mycroft – Holmes' elder brother (by seven years) – is telling Sherlock about Irene, he states that she is a dominatrix who gives out 'recreational scolding' to people. She has been in the middle of two political scandals in recent years, one of them involving a famous author, in which she had an affair with both sides.</p><Br>

    <p>She is brought to Sherlock's attention when he and John are summoned to Buckingham Palace by Mycroft and are asked to take on a case of national importance. Irene had taken compromising images of a young female member of the British Royal family during a dominatrix session.</p><br>

    <p>Even though Irene does not want money or power for the pictures, Sherlock is tasked in getting them back. She is using them, and other information for her 'protection'.</p>
