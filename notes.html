<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>This is the raw text for a website you'll be creating for the Narrative and Storytelling module.</p>

<p>You need to firstly mark everything up in Plain Old Semantic HTML (POSH). This content can be marked up as a single page site or a multi-page site, but consider semantics (HTML) and links (URLs). Once you've marked up your content you have two deliverables:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Build an initial immersive prototype (using XD, InVision, Figma, or similar) designed as part of a first design sprint. The deadline for this is for a critique in Week 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a finished website (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that iterates upon the initial immersive prototype and is designed as part of a second design sprint. The deadline for this is for a critique in Week 12.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Your website should be responsive and should work on mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Please do not dive right into the final build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong> What we want to see is a design process that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Starts with visual research;</li>
<li>Moves on to the creation of wireframes, mockups and prototypes (Weeks 1-6);</li>
<li>Before finally moving onto the final build.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>We are not looking for a straight out of the tin Bootstrap site, we're looking for something more considered and bespoke.</strong></p>

<p>You may wish to add links to the content supplied, or supplement the content, where appropriate.</p>

<p>â€”Christopher Murphy</p>

<p>Here's how I'd structure the site:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Life and Times of Sherlock Holmes (Home)</li>
<li>Heroes and Villains
<ul><li>Heroes</li>
<li>Sherlock Holmes</li>
<li>Dr Watson</li>
<li>Villains</li>
<li>Moriarty</li>
<li>Irene Adler</li></ul></li>
<li>On the Silver Screen</li>
<li>Measuring Mr Holmes</li>
<li>221B Baker Street</li>
</ol>
